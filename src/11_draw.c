 * The `draw_tex3` function renders the wall texture

 * y-coordinate for each screen pixel and draws the 
 * texture to the screen.

 * @param cub A pointer to a `t_main` structure that

 * 				screen where the wall texture should be drawn.
 * @param tex_x The x-coordinate of the texture for the wall
 * 				stripe.
 *
 * @details
 * - `step` is calculated to determine how much to advance
 * 	 	in the texture for each pixel row on the screen.
 * - `tex_pos` is initialized to the starting position 
 * 		in the texture and is updated for each pixel row.
 * - `tex_y` determines the vertical position within 
 * 		the texture based on `tex_pos`.
 * - The pixel value from the texture is extracted and 
 * 		used to set the pixel on the screen.
 * 
 * Why Bitshifting for `mlx_put_pixel`
 * 		These components are stored in a 32-bit value, 
 * 		with each component using 8 bits (1 byte). 
 * 		The structure is as follows:
 * 
 * R: 8 Bits (Bits 24 to 31)
 * G: 8 Bits (Bits 16 to 23)
 * B: 8 Bits (Bits 8 to 15)
 * A: 8 Bits (Bits 0 to 7)
