 * The direction is calculated based on the camera's
 * current view direction vector (`dir`) and the

 * X-coordinate on the screen influences the direction
 * of the ray.

/**
 * @brief Calculates the step size and side

 *
 * This function calculates the step size (`step.x` and 
 * `step.y`) and the side distance (`side_dist.x` and 
 * `side_dist.y`) for the ray based on its direction vector
 * (`raydr`) and the current position. The step size determines
 * the direction in which the ray moves through the grid, while
 * the side distance calculates the distance from the current
 * position to the next vertical or horizontal grid line.
 *
 * The calculations are performed as follows:
 * - If `raydr.x < 0`, the ray is moving to the left, so `step.x` 
 * 		is set to `-1` and `side_dist.x` is calculated as
 *   	`(pos.x - map_pos.x) * delta_dist.x`.
 * - If `raydr.x >= 0`, the ray is moving to the right, so `step.x` 
 * 		is set to `1` and `side_dist.x` is calculated as
 *   	`(map_pos.x + 1.0 - pos.x) * delta_dist.x`.
 * - If `raydr.y < 0`, the ray is moving downward, so `step.y` 
 * 		is set to `-1` and `side_dist.y` is calculated as
 *   	`(pos.y - map_pos.y) * delta_dist.y`.
 * - If `raydr.y >= 0`, the ray is moving upward, so `step.y` 
 * 		is set to `1` and `side_dist.y` is calculated as
 *   	`(map_pos.y + 1.0 - pos.y) * delta_dist.y`.

 * the closest intersection of the ray with the grid lines.
 *
 * The function compares the side distances to determine 
 * which direction to move the ray:
 * - If the distance to the next vertical grid line (`side_dist.x`)

 * 		(`side_dist.y`), the ray moves to the next vertical line.
 * - Otherwise, the ray moves to the next horizontal line.
 * 
 * Upon detecting a collision (when

 * `handle_wall_hit()` to handle the collision and determine the
